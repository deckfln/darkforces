bug
#1	FIXED		18/07/19	skybox background not displayed with defered renderer
#2	FIXED		20/11/19	glBufferAttribute::~glBufferAttribute is trigger a memory error when deleting one object
#3	FIXED		23/11/19	marie-jane "running" right fore arm is doing a full circle between 2 keyframes
#4	FIXED		24/11/19	marie-jane "running" gets suspened at the end of the animation loop
#5	FIXED		24/11/19	scene doesn't get resized when the window gets resized
#6	FIXED		24/11/19	animation speed is not corelated to time but maximum frames
#7				24/11/19	marie-jane "walking" doesn't display left boot
#8	FIXED		24/11/19	marie-jane all animations : face might be blackened (stencil buffer ?)
#9	CANCELED	25/11/19	marie-jane head is masked when the bloomed cube is behind here: automaticaly fixed
