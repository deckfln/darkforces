#1	28/05/19	cameraHelpler to show directional shadow
#2	28/05/19	sort instancedMesh by distance to camera (draw nearest first)
#3	31/05/19	void fwObject3D::updateWorldMatrix = > FIXME : checking the updated flag is bad => will not detect the shadowCamera projection
DONE #4	18/07/19	implement basic material on defered renderer
#4	20/07/19	implement bloom on defered renderer
#5	20/07/19	optimize glColorMap to NOT allocated depthBuffer if there is not need for it => postprocessing
#6	20/07/19	optimize renderer + postprocessing to use ping-pong color textures => stop allocating a color texture for each postprocessing

bug
FIXED #1	18/07/19	skybox background not displayed with defered renderer
